<p>I was in the Ads &amp; Commerce pillar mostly focussed on the DFP Platform
(Google Ads). Amongst my areas of focus was the reporting pipe - a high scale
data analytics system where I made various engineering upgrades and improvements
from full stack engineering to statistical fundamentals.</p>

<p>My other center of interest was insights and yield optimization where I got
involved with advanced auction theory and built inventory management systems.
I gave various talks during my tenure around Ads ecosystem, auction design,
game theory and hypercube analytics.</p>
