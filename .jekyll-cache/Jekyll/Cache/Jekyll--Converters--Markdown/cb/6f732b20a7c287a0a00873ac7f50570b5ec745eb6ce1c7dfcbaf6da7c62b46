    <h4>Career</h4>

    <h5>Instagram (June, 2017  - Now)</h5>

    <p>
      At Instagram my focus areas are recommendations, ranking, content understanding 
      and spam detection. I wear multiple hats ranging from individual contributor to
      lead researcher. My ever growing team has driven a meaningful amount of revenue
      for the company over the years. I am directly responsible for setting directions
      for ML at Instagram and researching/implementing the next generation of
      recommendation systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have mentored many scientists and engineers and have been involved in quite a
      few public conferences and talks with the rest of the ML community.
    </p>

    <h5>Google (May, 2015 - June, 2017)</h5>

    <p>
      I was in the Ads &amp; Commerce pillar mostly focussed on the DFP Platform
      (Google Ads). Amongst my areas of focus was the reporting pipe - a high scale
      data analytics system where I made various engineering upgrades and improvements
      from full stack engineering to statistical fundamentals.
    </p>

    <p>
      My other center of interest was insights and yield optimization where I got
      involved with advanced auction theory and built inventory management systems.
      I gave various talks during my tenure around Ads ecosystem, auction design,
      game theory and hypercube analytics.
    </p>

    <h5>Kantar (January 2014 - May, 2015)</h5>

    <p>
      I worked on a range of projects from ad campaign sentiment analysis using NLP to
      anomaly detection.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spent most of my time on campaign effectiveness and yield optimization.
      I've integrated with various ad serving systems and built real time statistical
      models for large data streams. I also wrote clustering methods to model
      attributions for ads ROI to major events.
    </p>

    <h5>Misc Startups (January 2010 - January 2014)</h5>

    During that time I joined a diverse panel of early stage startups where I had to
    wear many hats ranging from devops to full stack engineer and research
    scientist in between. 
    Amongst other things during that time I co-created an OSS project called 
    [Alternator](https://github.com/mboudreau/Alternator) and hacked my way
    around [DynamoDB](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10691547/how-to-store-gps-coordinate-and-search-places-in-a-radius-from-a-nosql-dbms-lik/10744352#10744352)
    to figure out how to percolate geobox searches before it was supported as a feature.

    <h5>Education</h5>

    I hold 3 graduate degrees in Mathematics, Statistics and Financial Engineering.
