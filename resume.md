    <h4>Career</h4>

    <h5>OpenAI (June 2025 - Present)</h5>

    <p>
      At OpenAI I focus on frontier machine learning research, designing and implementing cutting-edge AI systems and contributing to advances in the field.
    </p>

    <h5>Meta (April 2024 - March 2025)</h5>

    <p>
      Leading our core ads modeling efforts from retrieval to serving. Working on the typical large scale setups with sophisticated sequential architectures and GPU accelerations.
    </p>

    <h5>Instagram (June 2017 - April 2024)</h5>

    <p>
      At Instagram my focus areas were recommendations, ranking, content understanding and spam detection. I wore multiple hats ranging from individual contributor to lead researcher. My team drove meaningful revenue and set direction for machine learning across the product.
    </p>

    <p>
      I mentored many scientists and engineers and was involved in public conferences and talks with the broader ML community.
    </p>

    <h5>Google (May 2015 - June 2017)</h5>

    <p>
      I was in the Ads & Commerce pillar mostly focused on the DFP Platform (Google Ads). Among my areas of focus was the reporting pipeline, a high scale data analytics system where I made engineering upgrades and improvements from full stack engineering to statistical fundamentals.
    </p>

    <p>
      My other center of interest was insights and yield optimization where I got involved with advanced auction theory and built inventory management systems. I gave various talks during my tenure around Ads ecosystem, auction design, game theory and hypercube analytics.
    </p>

    <h5>Kantar (January 2014 - May 2015)</h5>

    <p>
      I worked on a range of projects from ad campaign sentiment analysis using NLP to anomaly detection.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spent most of my time on campaign effectiveness and yield optimization. I've integrated with various ad serving systems and built real time statistical models for large data streams. I also wrote clustering methods to model attributions for ads ROI to major events.
    </p>

    <h5>Misc Startups (January 2010 - January 2014)</h5>

    <p>
      During that time I joined a diverse panel of early stage startups where I had to wear many hats ranging from devops to full stack engineer and research scientist in between. Amongst other things during that time I co-created an OSS project called <a href="https://github.com/mboudreau/Alternator">Alternator</a> and hacked my way around <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10691547/how-to-store-gps-coordinate-and-search-places-in-a-radius-from-a-nosql-dbms-lik/10744352#10744352">DynamoDB</a> to figure out how to percolate geobox searches before it was supported as a feature.
    </p>

    <h4>Education</h4>

    <p>
      I hold 3 graduate degrees in Mathematics, Statistics and Financial Engineering.
